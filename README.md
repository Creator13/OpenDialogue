# OpenDialogue

There is no lack of dialogue editors for Unity, but most of them aren't free or are difficult to set up. OpenDialogue is an open-source project aimed at creating the most user-friendly, easy-to-use dialogue editor for Unity!

OpenDialogue is based on the GraphView API exposed in Unity 2019.1 and up. The new ShaderGraph and upcoming Visual Scripting plugins are based on this modern API. Even though it's still an experimental feature, this API is an impressive piece of technology and its continued existence is guaranteed by the tools mentioned before. Unity has [no plans](https://forum.unity.com/threads/graphview-official-support.672091/) to document the API, but the API seems stable enough for [good projects](https://github.com/alelievr/NodeGraphProcessor) to be created from it!

## This is a personal project and the plugin is work in progress. Feel free to contribute!
